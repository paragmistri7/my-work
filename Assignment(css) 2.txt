                    CSS properties allow authors to specify the foreground color and background of an element.
                    Backgrounds may be colors or images. Background properties allow authors to position a background
                    image, repeat it, and declare whether it should be fixed with respect to the viewport or scrolled
                    along with the document.

                    The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the
                    complexity will further increase. Color is an inherited property while the background is not.

        1) What is JavaScript?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web
            applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features
            on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.

        2) What is the use of isNaN function?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            The isNaN() function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It
            returns true if value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.isNaN()
            Method.

        3) What is negative Infinity?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value which is used to represent a value which
            is the lowest available. This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be
            generated using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation.

        4) Which company developed JavaScript?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            The first JavaScript engine was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, for the Netscape Navigator
            Web browser. The engine, code-named SpiderMonkey, is implemented in C. It has since been updated
            (in JavaScript 1.5) to conform to ECMAScript 3.

        5)What are undeclared and undefined variables?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <span> Undefined:</span> It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned
            with any value.
            Undefined is not a keyword.

            <span> Undeclared:</span> It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized
            or declared
            earlier using var or const keyword. If we use 'typeof' operator to get the value of an
            undeclared variable, we will face the runtime error with return value as “undefined”. The scope
            of the undeclared variables is always global.

        7) What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <span> SessionState:</span>
            If you want to store infromation that you want to access on different pages then you can use
            SessionState.
            SessionState is saved on the server.
            Data stored in the SesionState will be cleared when the session expired(usually after 20min of
            inactivity when using session inproc).
            SesionState is used to save the user specific data like UserID, User Role, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span> ViewState:</span>
            If you want to store information that you want to access only with in the page(same page) then
            you can use ViewState.
            ViewState is saved in the page.
            Data stored in the ViewState will send back to the server when postback action performed (no
            expiration).
            ViewState is used primarily by Server controls to retain state only on pages that post data back
            to themselves. And when you want to save the pagelevel data you can use ViewState.

        8) What is === operator?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            The strict equality operator (===) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a
            Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers
            operands of different types to be different.

        9) How can the style/class of an element be changed?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            The class name is used as a selector in HTML which helps to give some value to the element
            attributes. The document. getElementById() method is used to return the element in the document
            with the “id” attribute and the “className” attribute can be used to change/append the class of
            the element.

        10) How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <span> There are two ways to do it:</span>
            1. Using JavaScript extensions (runs from JavaScript Editor), or
            2. Using a web page and ActiveX objects (Internet Explorer only)
            In JavaScript Extensions, you can use
            fh = fopen(getScriptPath(), 0); to open a file
            Using ActiveX objects, following should be included in your code to read a file:
            var fso = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
            var s = fso.OpenTextFile("C:\\example.txt", 1, true).

        11) What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            In Java, there are three kinds of loops which are – the for loop, the while loop, and the
            do-while loop. All these three loop constructs of Java executes a set of repeated statements as
            long as a specified condition remains true. This particular condition is generally known as loop
            control.

    <h2>
        12) 12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed in string
            parameter or value to an integer value itself. This function returns an integer of base which is
            specified in second argument of parseInt() function.
            <br>
            parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn’t contain number.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, the delete operator is employed to delete a property of an object. After deleting
            the actual property, that property won’t be accessible and returns undefined.

    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across
            the term “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side
            effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page.

        17) What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            There is no append support without reparsing the whole innerHTML. This makes changing innerHTML
            directly very slow. innerHTML does not provide validation and therefore we can potentially
            insert valid and broken HTML in the document and break it.
